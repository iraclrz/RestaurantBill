# RestaurantBill
(Restaurant Bill Application) Develop an application that calculates a restaurant bill. 
The user should be able to enter the item ordered, the quantity of the item ordered and the price per item. 
When the user clicks the Add Item Button, your application should display the number ordered, the item ordered and the price per unit in three List Boxes. 
When the user clicks the Total Bill Button, the application should calculate the total cost. 
For each entry in the ListBox, multiply the cost of each item by the number ofitems ordered.
