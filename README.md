# RestaurantBill
The Restaurant Bill Application is designed to simplify the process of calculating bills in a restaurant setting. It facilitates user input of item details such as the name, quantity, and price per item. Upon clicking the "Add Item" button, the application dynamically updates three list boxes to display the entered information: the number ordered, the item ordered, and the price per unit. This intuitive interface ensures transparency and ease of use for the user. Furthermore, when the user clicks the "Total Bill" button, the application swiftly computes the total cost of the bill. It accomplishes this by multiplying the cost of each item by the quantity ordered and summing up these costs. This functionality streamlines the billing process and reduces the margin for error. Leveraging the C# programming language, the application employs square bracket notation to efficiently access and manipulate each item in the list boxes. This choice of language ensures robustness and scalability. Overall, the Restaurant Bill Application offers a seamless and efficient solution for restaurant bill calculation, enhancing the overall customer experience.
